This page let users to enter a title for something they want to count down to.
There is a video background to show counting-down animation.

The cool thing about this project is also that we are storing our countdown information in local storage. So it allows users to refresh the page or come back to the page on another day and the countdown will still be running.

This site is also mobile, responsive as well.
